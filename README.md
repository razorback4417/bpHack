# Krowd
Krowd is a website that provides an optimal way to crowdfund and provides a more widespread reach for fundraisers. Using quadratic funding, people are given more incentive to donate, solving the problem of people not donating because they feel they don't need to. Quadratic funding is where the amount received by a project by a project is proportional to the square of the sum of the square roots of contributions received.
